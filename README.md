#**Abstract**#:
This is a machine-learning project to detect fabric wetness based on fabric humidity, fabric temperature, and room humidity and temperature. 


**Background**
In Bangladesh, during the rainy season, people hang their clothes inside their homes to dry. However, wet clothes increase the humidity of the house, which can cause fungus and mold to build up.
Microparticles of fungus can go to your lungs when you breathe in and cause respiratory diseases. Our project is the first step to solving a bigger problem. We are trying to 
get as accurate as possible for fabric wetness detection so that a machine or system can be built to deal with this problem.

**Work Done**
1. We have created a prototype device to detect fabric wetness using Arduino Uno and DHT22.
2. We have created our dataset with this device.
3. We have trained some machine learning models on the dataset to predict fabric wetness based on some features.

**Future Work**
1. We will try to build a model of our own to get a more precise prediction
2. We will try to implement this in a real-world application
